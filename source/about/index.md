# Hi!

I am a student from a middle school. My Chinese name is Wu Chengyu(you also can call me my real name 吴承宇). 
It is busy of my schoolwork. Besides information technology, I am more interested in mathematics, English, physics and chemistry in the subject. I am also interested in Japnese too because of `Kenshi Yonezu`(米津 玄師) and `Huzuru Hanyu`(羽生 結弦). 

# What am I doing?

As a student, my main job is to study. This is also a station for me to practise my `English`(BECAUSE IT HAS **120'** IN `Junior High School Academic Level Examination`). Besides, do you have any advice for me to improve my Literature(Chinese)? Thank you.

# What you can learn here?

If you are good enough, reading here can mean nothing, and you can <key>exit</key> from this page via <key>CommandOrCtrl</key> + <key>W</key>(_I think it's so simple that I don't need to teach you, right?_)

If you are routed by the search engine, you must have some difficulties, or you are just free a lot. You can see the `index` to know more.

What I share: **Learning Tips In SchoolWork**, **Web (FULL STACK) Developing Knowledge**, and so on...

Time flies by, and it is time to go to school today. GOODBYE! Hope you to find something you are found!
