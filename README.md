Allow me to reintroduce myself.

Once upon a time, I had the time to write a little school demerit management platform for the Discipline Department, and then by some fluke, I became the president of the student council of my junior high school.

In terms of development, I think I've mastered a certain amount of `vue` as a front-end development method and responsive mechanism, while the back-end is barely able to use `koa` to satisfy most of the needs.

I'm currently learning machine learning, but I've only implemented one-dimensional linear regression and simple gradient descent, so I haven't yet figured out the mechanics of machine learning.

Currently attending Zhenhai Middle School in Zhejiang Province, just a humble ordinary classmate, and not in the age leading position.

But I ultimately still believe in one sentence: the carefully constructed worship is unbearable, and the love from the heart is so touching.

Only by truly improving myself can I truly take my place.

In my spare time, I play games like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Phigros. I don't play at a high level, but I can have a little fun with them.

What I hope to truly become is not just a blowhard in the information technology world, but a living, breathing human being with real values and ideas.
