Hi there üëã, I am @7086cmd.

I am a student in a middle school, and I am the chairman of the student union. There are many OIers in my school but I am not.

I always code at home, and I want to master Python(I only can use ‚Äúprint‚Äù in python!!!)

If you want to connect with me, please send me with telegram: @wcydeveloper7086cmd

Here are my fun projects.



#### Project doing

- [Magnifique](https://github.com/7086cmd/magnifique). It is a IT platform for students in my school. In September, I made a simple deduction-platform, and won the elect with this platform on October. I want to make a better one. The project is the alias of `Stunning`. Because the secure problem, I deleted the secret information.
- [jsoi](https://github.com/7086cmd/jsoi). As we all known, I was a OIer. Now I used `TypeScript` to pass OI problems in `luogu`. Here are my sources.

#### Project Planning

- [Quasiparticle](https://github.com/7086cmd/quasiparticle). It is not developing now because of `Magnifique`, but it also is a fun project. It is like a GUI Interface to make projects with less code.
